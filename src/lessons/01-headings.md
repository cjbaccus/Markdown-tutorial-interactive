Markdown uses the `#` symbol to create headings. The number of `#` symbols determines the heading level.

**Syntax:**
```
# Heading 1 (Largest)
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6 (Smallest)
```

**Important:** Always add a space between the `#` symbol and your text.

Try it yourself in the editor!
