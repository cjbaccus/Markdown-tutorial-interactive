Markdown provides simple ways to emphasize text:

**Bold Text:**
- Use `**text**` or `__text__`
- Example: `**bold**` becomes **bold**

**Italic Text:**
- Use `*text*` or `_text_`
- Example: `*italic*` becomes *italic*

**Bold and Italic:**
- Use `***text***` or `___text___`
- Example: `***bold italic***` becomes ***bold italic***

**Tips:**
- Asterisks (`*`) are more commonly used than underscores
- Don't put spaces between the emphasis markers and the text
